    question: "How do I create a product with you? ",
    answer: `If you have an idea contact us by our online form available under contact page, e-mail or phone. We'll meet and talk it over. 
    Just be sure to prepare as much info about your idea as possible, it will smoothen the meeting and benefit further cooperation.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What do I need to know before contacting you? ",
    answer: `Well, the most important thing to know is what do you want to accomplish. 
    Why do I need this software? What for? What should it do? Having a clear vision in mind is crucial when ordering a software application. 
    You don't want to spend many months developing it with us without being sure what you need. If you have no experience in app development 
    feel free to contact us. We'll also be glad to help you get started, building projects from scratch is nothing new for us.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after you finish my app? ",
    answer: `Hopefully the app is exactly what you dreamed of :) But apart from delivering a finished product, 
    we are happy to provide you with technical support and app maintenance should you need it. After all, we know our work inside out. 
    Of course if you want to maintain the app by yourself the source code and all technical data is at your disposal, 
    but even in that case, feel free to contact us if you need any help.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Will development include the creation of prototypes and demo versions that I can try out? ",
    answer: `We would not call it exactly a demo version but using Agile Methodolgy compels us to create operating software as soon as 
    possible and later just add next features along the process. Therefore, you'll be able to examine and test your software very early.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Can the software be upgraded in the future as new technology becomes available? ",
    answer: `Of course! We are always happy to improve, upgrade and further develop our work.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What if I come to you with a product that I want to improve? ",
    answer: `Weâ€™ll be more than happy to help you with that. Beginning with a UX Audit (if applicable) through improving your system architecture and adding new features.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How do you guarantee product quality? ",
    answer: `We evaluate the result after every two weeks, we test our work (we conduct both development 
    and acceptance tests), we present it to you, we apply your feedback so you know you get what you are paying for.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How much do you charge? ",
    answer: `It depends on many things: project scope, time spent on the project and technological issues. 
    We know it sounds vague but its simply honest. Remember that each software project is different, 
    especially if you had a particularly original idea. We do not want to give you an unrealistic estimate, 
    instead we want to provide you with the best quality possible within your budget.`,
